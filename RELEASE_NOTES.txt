Release Notes: Revive Adserver 5.6.0
====================================

These release notes cover what's new, system requirements, download and
installation instructions, known issues and frequently asked questions for
Revive Adserver. Please read these notes before reporting any bugs.


What's New in Revive Adserver 5.6.0
-----------------------------------

 * Release date: t.b.d.


Security Updates
----------------

 * None


New Features
------------

 * Added "Link: rel=preconnect" header when using SSL connection and images
   are hosted on a different hostname then delivery (e.g. CDN), in order to
   speed up ad rendering on a page.

 * Added new "addMagicMacros" delivery plugin hook.

 * New displayNameLength configuration directive to increase the length of
   campaign and banner names displayed in the zone linking screens.

 * Added loading animation when the next screen is taking some time to load
   and a new UI setting to disable or customise how long to wait before
   displaying the loader (defaults to 250ms).

 * Improved pruning of the data_summary_ad_zone_assoc table.

 * Added new command to delete orphaned images or HTML5 banner folders.
   The command can be executed using the new script/console entry point,
   based on Symfony Console Command component.

 * Added support for writing to a fail2ban compatible log file on unsuccessful
   login attempts.

 * Replaced advertiser and website statistics with a new account statistics
   screen for administrator users.
 

Bug Fixes
---------

 * HEAD requests to delivery scripts were previously executed and counted
   as proper requests, even though the ad payload would have been discarded.

 * Fixed issue with the search functionality being case-sensitive when
   using a Postgres database.

 * Optimimized some queries used in the statistics screen, leading to
   faster response times on very large instances.

 * Changed the OAGEO cookie from session cookie to permanent, with a 30m
   expiration time. This should allow refreshing geo information for mobile
   users on the move.

 * Fixed the definition of the "acls" and "acls_channel" tables so that they
   have a proper primary key.

 * Fixed the definition of the "banners_vast_element" table in the IAB VAST
   Plugin to use a primary key and avoid the creation of an additional
   "banners_vast_element_seq" table on MySQL without any prefix.

 * Fixed an issue preventing contract campaigns from working properly with
   hour of day limitation in non-UTC timezones or with campaigns having
   daily targets.


Non-Backwards Compatible Changes
--------------------------------

 * Revive Adserver now requires at least PHP 8.1

 * Deprecated [rawDatabase] section in the config file is no longer supported.

 * Deprecated SQL stored banners: the default setting for new installations is
   to disallow SQL stored banners.

Known Issues
------------

This list covers some of the known problems with Revive Adserver. Please read
this before reporting any new bugs.

 * The upgrade process may time out with very large databases. See
   https://www.revive-adserver.com/docs/faq for more information if you
   have a large database.

 * If you want to run Revive Adserver with MySQL, please note that MySQL 4.1 or
   higher is required. If you are using an older version of MySQL, you will
   need to update you database software before upgrading.

 * If you want to run Revive Adserver with PostgreSQL, please note that
   PostgreSQL 8.1 or higher is required. If you are using an older version of
   PostgreSQL, you will need to update your database software before
   upgrading.

 * Some of the PEAR libraries used are not compatible with database prefix
   names with double "_" characters (e.g. "rv__"). You should NOT install
   Revive Adserver with a prefix of this format.

 * Some users have reported issues of being logged out when viewing
   statistics. This can be worked around by ensuring that the timezone is
   correctly set in PHP.
